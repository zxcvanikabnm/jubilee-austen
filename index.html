            <h2>A litttle bit about me.</h2>
            <p>
                I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.

            <p>
                That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom and versatility I was looking for in my work. Now, I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.

            <h3>Hand-Coded <span>html</span></h3> 
            <p>
               My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic <span>html</span>5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.
